# Harmonizing the Digital Soundscape: Development of a Full-Stack Music Streaming Platform with Role-Based Access Control

## Abstract

Music streaming platforms typically separate listeners and artists, creating a fragmented experience where users need different applications for consuming and creating content. This project aims to solve this problem by developing a unified platform where both activities can happen together. Groovy is a full-stack web application that allows users to listen to music, create playlists, and manage favorites, while artists can upload and manage their music, and administrators can oversee all system operations. The main goals were to build a user-friendly interface, develop a secure backend system, and implement proper authentication with different user roles (regular users, artists, and administrators). To create this platform, I used React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, which provides an intuitive music player and content management interface. For the backend, I implemented a Spring Boot API with JPA that handles data storage, user authentication through JWT tokens, and file management for music streaming. The project successfully achieves its objectives by creating a platform where users can enjoy music through features like playlists and favorites, artists can manage their music portfolios, and administrators can control all aspects of the platform through a single integrated system. This approach creates a more connected music ecosystem that benefits both listeners and creators.
